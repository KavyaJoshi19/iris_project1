# iris_project1

Overview :

This project classifies iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements using machine learning techniques. The Iris dataset, a classic in ML, consists of 150 samples with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Objectives:

 1. Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
 2. Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN).
 3.Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

Technologies Used:

 1. Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
 2. Tools: Jupyter Notebook
    
Implementation Steps:

1. Load and visualize the dataset.
2. Preprocess data and split it into training and test sets.
3. Train and evaluate models.

Results:
1. Best Model: Random Forest with 96% accuracy.
2. Models achieved high precision, recall, and F1 scores across classes.
